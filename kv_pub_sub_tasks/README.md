# KV Cache Event Synchronization Tasks

This directory contains the implementation tasks for the KV cache event synchronization feature between vLLM and AIBrix gateway.

## Document Overview

### Main Documents
- [kv-cache-event-sync-design.md](kv-cache-event-sync-design.md) - Overall system design
- [000-implementation-guide.md](000-implementation-guide.md) - Implementation roadmap and best practices

### Implementation Tasks
1. [001-zmq-client-implementation.md](001-zmq-client-implementation.md) - ZMQ client for subscribing to vLLM events
2. [002-cache-system-integration.md](002-cache-system-integration.md) - Integration with AIBrix cache system
3. [003-routing-algorithm-integration.md](003-routing-algorithm-integration.md) - Updating prefix cache router
4. [004-vllm-configuration-deployment.md](004-vllm-configuration-deployment.md) - vLLM deployment configuration
5. [005-testing-and-validation.md](005-testing-and-validation.md) - Comprehensive testing framework
6. [006-monitoring-and-operations.md](006-monitoring-and-operations.md) - Monitoring and operational tools

## Quick Start

Engineers should:
1. Read the implementation guide (000)
2. Review the overall design document
3. Follow tasks 001-006 in sequence
4. Each task is self-contained with clear requirements and implementation details

## Timeline

- **Week 1**: Tasks 001-002 (Foundation)
- **Week 2**: Tasks 003-004 (Integration)
- **Week 3**: Tasks 005-006 (Validation & Operations)

Total estimated effort: 3 weeks with 2-3 engineers

## Key Technologies

- **ZMQ**: For event pub/sub
- **MessagePack**: For event serialization
- **Go**: Implementation language
- **Kubernetes**: Deployment platform
- **Prometheus/Grafana**: Monitoring

## Important Configuration Dependencies

The KV event sync feature **requires** remote tokenizer to be enabled:

```bash
# These environment variables must be configured in order:
AIBRIX_USE_REMOTE_TOKENIZER=true     # Must be enabled first
AIBRIX_KV_EVENT_SYNC_ENABLED=true    # Depends on remote tokenizer
```

This dependency ensures tokenization consistency between the gateway and vLLM engines, which is critical for accurate hash computation and cache state synchronization.
