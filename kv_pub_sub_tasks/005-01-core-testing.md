# Task 005-01: Core Testing Framework

## Overview
Implementation of core testing components for the KV cache event synchronization system, focusing on essential unit tests and basic integration tests.

## Scope

### 1. ZMQ Client Unit Tests (`pkg/cache/kvcache/zmq_client_test.go`)
- Connection and reconnection logic
- Event processing and handling
- Error scenarios and recovery
- Mock publisher implementation

### 2. Sync Indexer Unit Tests (`pkg/utils/syncprefixcacheindexer/sync_hash_test.go`)
- ProcessBlockStored event handling
- ProcessBlockRemoved event handling
- Concurrent event processing
- Memory management and cleanup

### 3. Cache Integration Tests (`pkg/cache/kv_event_manager_test.go`)
- Pod lifecycle management
- Configuration dependency validation
- Subscription logic
- Event manager initialization

### 4. Basic Integration Tests
- Pod addition/update/deletion flows
- Configuration dependency checks
- Basic event flow validation

### 5. Basic CI/CD Integration
- Unit test execution in GitHub Actions
- Code coverage reporting
- Test result visualization

## Implementation Priority
1. ZMQ Client Tests (Critical - new component)
2. Sync Indexer Tests (Critical - core functionality)
3. Cache Integration Tests (High - system integration)
4. Basic Integration Tests (Medium - validation)
5. CI/CD Setup (Medium - automation)

## Success Criteria
- 95%+ coverage for ZMQ client
- 90%+ coverage for sync indexer
- 90%+ coverage for cache integration
- All tests pass consistently
- CI runs on every PR
