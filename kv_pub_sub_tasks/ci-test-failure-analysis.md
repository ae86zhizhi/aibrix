# CI Test Failure Analysis

## Problem Summary
GitHub Actions CI test failed on push with the following error:
- **Test**: `TestMockZMQPublisher` 
- **File**: `pkg/cache/kvcache/zmq_client_test.go:257`
- **Error**: Expected 1 event, but received 2 events
- **CI Run**: https://github.com/ae86zhizhi/aibrix/actions/runs/16567549246/job/46851182834

## Error Details
```
Error Trace:    /home/runner/work/aibrix/aibrix/pkg/cache/kvcache/zmq_client_test.go:257
Error:          "[0xc00014d780 0xc00014d800]" should have 1 item(s), but has 2
Test:           TestMockZMQPublisher
--- FAIL: TestMockZMQPublisher (5.41s)
```

## Test Context
The test runs successfully locally but fails in CI. This suggests:
- Timing differences between local and CI environment
- Possible race condition in the test
- Event duplication in CI environment

## Key Information

### Test Location
- File: `pkg/cache/kvcache/zmq_client_test.go`
- Line: 257
- Function: `TestMockZMQPublisher`

### What the Test Does
1. Creates a mock ZMQ publisher
2. Sends events to a ZMQ client
3. Verifies the client receives expected events
4. Line 257 appears to be checking event count

### CI Environment
- Ubuntu runner
- Go version matches local
- libzmq installed via apt-get
- Tests run with `-tags="zmq"`

## Required Actions

1. **Examine the specific assertion at line 257**
2. **Check for timing/race conditions**
3. **Verify event deduplication logic**
4. **Consider CI-specific delays**

## Files to Check
- `pkg/cache/kvcache/zmq_client_test.go` - The failing test
- `pkg/cache/kvcache/zmq_client.go` - Implementation being tested

## Debugging Commands
```bash
# Run the specific test locally
go test -v -tags="zmq" -run TestMockZMQPublisher ./pkg/cache/kvcache/

# Run with race detector
go test -race -tags="zmq" -run TestMockZMQPublisher ./pkg/cache/kvcache/

# Run multiple times to catch intermittent failures
for i in {1..10}; do go test -tags="zmq" -run TestMockZMQPublisher ./pkg/cache/kvcache/ || break; done
```

## Potential Fixes
1. Add synchronization to ensure events are processed sequentially
2. Add delays or wait conditions for CI environment
3. Check if duplicate events are expected behavior
4. Add event deduplication if needed
