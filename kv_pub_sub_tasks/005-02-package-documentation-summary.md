### 1. pkg/cache/kvcache/README.md
**Purpose**: Documents the ZMQ-based KV cache event client
**Key Sections**:
- Component overview (ZMQ client, event types, msgpack codec)
- Usage examples with code snippets
- Configuration via environment variables
- Testing instructions
- Dependencies (libzmq requirement)

### 2. pkg/utils/syncprefixcacheindexer/README.md
**Purpose**: Documents the prefix cache indexing system
**Key Sections**:

## Documentation Standards

All READMEs follow consistent structure:
1. Overview - What the package does
2. Components - Key parts and their roles
3. Usage - Code examples
4. Configuration - Environment variables
5. Testing - How to run tests
6. Dependencies - External requirements

This ensures developers can quickly understand and use the new functionality without referring to internal task documentation.
