# KV Cache Event Synchronization Implementation Guide

## Overview

This guide provides the implementation roadmap for the KV cache event synchronization system between vLLM inference engines and AIBrix gateway. The system enables real-time prefix cache visibility for optimal routing decisions.

## Architecture Summary

### System Components

1. **vLLM Side**
   - Built-in KV event publisher (ZMQ)
   - Ports: 5557 (PUB), 5558 (ROUTER for replay)
   - MessagePack serialization

2. **AIBrix Gateway Side**
   - KV Event Manager (cache system integration)
   - ZMQ Client (event subscription)
   - Sync Hash Indexer (state management)
   - Prefix Cache Router (routing decisions)

3. **Data Flow**
   ```
   vLLM KV Operations → ZMQ Events → Gateway Subscriber → Sync Indexer → Router
   ```

## Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
- [Task 001](001-zmq-client-implementation.md): ZMQ Client Implementation
- [Task 002](002-cache-system-integration.md): Cache System Integration

### Phase 2: Integration (Week 2)
- [Task 003](003-routing-algorithm-integration.md): Routing Algorithm Integration
- [Task 004](004-vllm-configuration-deployment.md): vLLM Configuration & Deployment

### Phase 3: Validation (Week 3)
- [Task 005](005-testing-and-validation.md): Testing and Validation
- [Task 006](006-monitoring-and-operations.md): Monitoring and Operations

## Backward Compatibility

This implementation maintains **full backward compatibility**:

1. **When both features are disabled** (`AIBRIX_USE_REMOTE_TOKENIZER=false` and `AIBRIX_KV_EVENT_SYNC_ENABLED=false`):
   - System behaves exactly as before
   - Uses local tokenizer (character or tiktoken)
   - Maintains local prefix cache based on requests
   - No external dependencies

2. **When only remote tokenizer is enabled**:
   - Uses remote tokenizer for consistency
   - Prefix cache works locally without KV events
   - Falls back to local tokenizer if remote fails

3. **When both features are enabled**:
   - Full KV event synchronization
   - Real-time cache state from vLLM
   - Enhanced routing accuracy

## Best Practices

### 1. Code Organization
```
pkg/
├── cache/
│   ├── kv_event_manager.go      # Main integration point
│   ├── kv_event_handler.go      # Event processing logic
│   └── kvcache/                 # ZMQ client package
│       ├── zmq_client.go
│       ├── event_types.go
│       └── metrics.go
├── utils/
│   └── syncprefixcacheindexer/  # Existing indexer
└── plugins/
    └── gateway/
        └── algorithms/
            └── prefix_cache.go   # Updated router
```

### 2. Configuration Management
- Use environment variables for runtime configuration
- Provide sensible defaults
- Make features toggleable (feature flags)
- Document all configuration options
- **Enforce feature dependencies**: KV sync requires remote tokenizer
  ```
  AIBRIX_USE_REMOTE_TOKENIZER=true    # Must be enabled first
  AIBRIX_KV_EVENT_SYNC_ENABLED=true   # Depends on remote tokenizer
  ```

### 3. Error Handling
- Graceful degradation when KV sync unavailable
- Exponential backoff for reconnections
- Circuit breaker pattern for failing connections
- Clear error messages with context

### 4. Performance Optimization
- Lock-free operations where possible
- Batch event processing
- Efficient data structures (sync.Map)
- Minimize allocations in hot paths

### 5. Monitoring and Observability
- Metrics for every operation
- Structured logging with appropriate levels
- Distributed tracing support
- Health check endpoints

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Why Sync Hash Indexer?
- Maintains consistency between gateway and engine state
- Handles hash computation differences
- Supports multiple models and LoRA adapters
- Efficient memory usage with eviction

### 2. Why ZMQ?
- Native support in vLLM
- High performance pub/sub
- Built-in replay capability
- Battle-tested in production

### 3. Why Remote Tokenizer?
- Ensures tokenization consistency
- Eliminates discrepancies
- Supports multiple engines
- Future-proof design

### 4. Why Remote Tokenizer is Required for KV Sync?
- **Hash Consistency**: KV cache blocks are hashed based on tokenized input
- **Token Mismatch Prevention**: Different tokenizers produce different token IDs
- **Accurate State Sync**: Gateway must use same tokenization as vLLM engine
- **Routing Accuracy**: Incorrect hashes lead to cache misses and suboptimal routing

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **ZMQ Connection Stability**
   - Mitigation: Robust reconnection logic, health checks

2. **Memory Growth**
