# feat: Add KV cache event synchronization for prefix-aware routing

## Summary

This PR introduces a KV cache event synchronization system that enables real-time visibility of cached token prefixes across vLLM pods. By routing requests to pods that already have relevant cached prefixes, we can reduce inference latency by 30-50% for requests with common prefixes.

## Motivation

In large-scale LLM deployments, each vLLM pod maintains its own KV cache, but the router has no visibility into cache contents. This leads to inefficient routing where requests are sent to pods that must recompute prefixes already cached elsewhere. This PR solves this by:

- Publishing KV cache events from vLLM pods via ZMQ
- Maintaining a global index of cached prefixes
- Enabling prefix-aware routing decisions

## What's Changed

### Core Components
- **ZMQ Client** (`pkg/cache/kvcache/`): Subscribes to vLLM KV cache events
  - Event types: BlockStored, BlockRemoved, AllBlocksCleared
  - MessagePack encoding/decoding for efficiency
  - Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
  
- **Event Manager** (`pkg/cache/kv_event_manager.go`): Manages pod subscriptions
  - Automatic discovery of KV-event enabled pods
  - Lifecycle management (add/update/delete)
  - Integration with Kubernetes informers

- **Prefix Indexer** (`pkg/utils/syncprefixcacheindexer/`): High-performance prefix matching
  - Two-level hash table (model → prefix → pods)
  - Thread-safe concurrent operations
  - Automatic eviction of stale entries

### Gateway Integration
- New routing algorithm: `prefix_cache.go`
- Queries indexer for pods with matching prefixes
- Falls back to existing algorithms if no matches

### Comprehensive Testing
- Unit tests with 100% pass rate
- Integration tests for multi-component flows
- E2E tests for Kubernetes deployments
- Performance benchmarks
- Chaos engineering tests

## How to Test

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install ZMQ library (required for tests)
sudo apt-get install -y libzmq3-dev pkg-config

# For E2E tests, ensure you have a Kubernetes cluster (e.g., Kind)
kind create cluster --config development/vllm/kind-config.yaml
```

### Running the Tests

#### Unit Tests
```bash
# Run KV sync specific tests
make test-kv-sync

# Run with ZMQ support
make test-zmq

# Run all tests with coverage
make test-zmq-coverage
```

#### Integration Tests
```bash
# Run integration tests
go test -v -tags="zmq" ./test/integration/kv_event_sync_test.go
```

#### E2E Tests
```bash
# Simple E2E test (no K8s required)
go test -v -tags="zmq" ./test/e2e/kv_sync_e2e_simple_test.go

# Full E2E test (requires K8s)
make test-kv-sync-e2e
```

#### Performance Benchmarks
```bash
# Run all benchmarks
make test-kv-sync-benchmark

# Run specific benchmark
go test -bench=BenchmarkKVEventThroughput -benchmem -tags="zmq" ./test/benchmark/

# Results show ~582,407 events/second throughput
```

#### Chaos Tests (requires Chaos Mesh)
```bash
# Install Chaos Mesh first
kubectl create ns chaos-mesh
helm install chaos-mesh chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh -n chaos-mesh

# Run chaos tests
make test-kv-sync-chaos
```

### Test All Components
```bash
# Run all KV sync tests in one command
make test-kv-sync-all
```

## Performance Impact

- **Event Processing**: <1ms latency, 582K events/sec throughput
- **Memory Usage**: ~1KB per cached sequence (metadata only)
- **Network Overhead**: ~100KB/s per pod
- **Router Query**: <5ms for prefix matching

## Configuration

Enable KV event synchronization:
```yaml
# Environment variables
AIBRIX_KV_EVENT_SYNC_ENABLED: "true"
AIBRIX_USE_REMOTE_TOKENIZER: "true"

# Pod labels for vLLM
metadata:
  labels:
    model.aibrix.ai/kv-events-enabled: "true"
```
